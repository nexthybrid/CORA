# CORA - cut-in Branch
This branch developes a vehicle cut-in simulation using CORA. Then ODD-based safety verification is applied to the reachability result.

### The cut-in scenario
The cut-in scenario involves two vehicles and two lanes. The detailed model equations can be found in `Two_vehicle_model_cut_in.pdf`.
